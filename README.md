# Movie Recommendation System Using Feature Extraction

This is a movie recommendation system built using FEATURE EXTRACTION.

# HOW DOES IT WORK?

The technique used to build this recommendation system is FEATURE EXTRACTION, which basically means all the necessary features shall be seperated and saved in a variable. Using TfidfVectorizer() the feature vectors are extracted and the cosine similarity is used to find the similarity between the user's search and these vectors.
